# -Global-Broadband-Speed-Scraper-Database-Integrator
This project provides a robust solution for collecting and storing global broadband speed data, facilitating further analysis and visualization.

This repository contains Python scripts to scrape data from Speedtest.net's Global Index page (https://www.speedtest.net/global-index) and extract information about mobile and fixed broadband connections worldwide. The extracted data is then processed and stored in separate CSV files for mobile and broadband connections. Additionally, the data is stored in two distinct tables in a MySQL database, preserving all the relevant columns mentioned on the Speedtest.net website such as Mbps, ranking, etc.

Features:
- Automated web scraping of Speedtest.net Global Index for mobile and fixed broadband connection data.
- Data processing and storage in separate CSV files for easy access and analysis.
- Integration with MySQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Comprehensive column inclusion to ensure all relevant metrics are captured accurately.
